Comments:
    Every word that isn't a number (any digit, - and .) is a comment

Special features:
    Exiting:
        Jump to address -1, -2 is the exit code
    Printing:
        Jump to address -3 to print the number in -5 to stdout, return to -6
        Jump to address -4 to print the number in -5 to stderr, return to -6
        both of these reset -5 and -6 after running

Comment conventions in examples:
    number in brackets:
        "variable" (always written directly after value or address of something)
    number in square brackets:
        There to escape numbers so that they're seen as comment by the emulator
